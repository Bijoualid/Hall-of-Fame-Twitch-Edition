Rules :
  1 To join the Hall of Fame Twitch Edition, you must already have a Twitch account.
  
  2 Send a picture of you or your logo.
  
  3 Send a very short description about you and what you do (150 characters max).

  As a student, please be aware that this page will improve as I learn. Here are the next improvements that will appear on the     page:
  
  1 A navigation bar in order to be able to find Streamers based on the games they play and the language. 

  2 A back-end system to allow people to join the Hall-of-Fame-Twitch-Edition with an account.
  
  3 If you have a blog or website and want to share this page i also want to create a system that allows you to choose only certain streamers to display on your page as long as all the links of the community appear.
