# Hall-of-Fame-Twitch-Edition


The principle of the Hall of Fame Twitch Edition remains the same as that of the Hall of Fame (https://bijoualid.github.io/Hall-of-Fame/). 
If you are a Twitch streamer and looking to promote yourself, you have come to the right place.

Rules :
  1 To join the Hall of Fame Twitch Edition, you must already have a Twitch account.
  
  2 Send a picture of you or your logo.
  
  3 Send a very short description about you and what you do (150 characters max).
  
  4 As in the example, select 1 or 3 games you play the most.
  
  5 Send the link of your Twitch Channel and another link like Youtube if you have one.
